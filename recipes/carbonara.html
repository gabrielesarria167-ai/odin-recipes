    <h2>Ingredients (4 portions)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>320 g of Spaghetti</li>
        <li>150 g of Jowls</li>
        <li>6 egg yolks</li>
        <li>50 g of Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Start by putting a pot of salted water on the stove to cook the pasta.
                <br>
                In the meantime, remove the rind from the guanciale and cut it first into slices and then into strips
                about 3/8-inch thick.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Place the pieces of guanciale in a non-stick pan and brown them for about 10 minutes over medium-high
                heat, being careful not to burn it, or it will release a strong aroma.
                <br>
                Meanwhile, plunge the spaghetti into the boiling water and cook them al dente.
                <br>
                In the meantime, pour the yolks into a bowl.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Add the Pecorino and season with black pepper.
                <br>
                Blend everything with a hand whisk until you obtain a smooth cream.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the guanciale will be cooked;
                turn off the heat and using a slotted spoon, remove it from the pan, leaving the cooking base in the pan
                itself.
                <br>
                Transfer the guanciale to a small bowl and set it aside.
                Pour a ladleful of pasta water into the pan, along with the guanciale fat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Drain the pasta al dente directly into the pan with the cooking base.
                <br>
                Toss it briefly to flavor it. Remove from the heat and pour the egg and Pecorino mixture into the pan.
                <br>
                Mix quickly to combine.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                To make it creamy, if needed, you can add a little pasta cooking water.
                <br>
                Add the guanciale, mix one last time, and serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, adding more
                Pecorino on top and a pinch of black pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
